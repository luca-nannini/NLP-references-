    "#### Purpose\n",
    "This a personal repository where I report all the useful open source links that helped me along the path of my education in Data Science and NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Copyrights Infringements intended; upon request, material will be removed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Data Science, Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing](#1.-Data-Science,-Machine-Learning-&-Natural-Language-Processing)\n",
    "1. [Computational Pragmatics & Probabilistic Modeling](#2.-Computational-Pragmatics-&-Probabilistic-Modeling)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Graphic Overview\n",
    "As graphic interface, I created a [Google Drive Drawing File](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Bjx63f0msCARWHv6a4MPADDM_n-m13LBTa_Tk7nMimk/edit?usp=sharing) collecting all these links as interconnected branches of different disciplines. The original purpose of it was to associate Communication Studies (e.g. Linguistics, Semiotics, Pragmatics, Formal Semantics and Causal Reasoning) along with their computational tools, methods and approaches (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, Computational Semantics, Computational Pragmatics, Probabilistic Modeling).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right, there are proposed some links to articles, tutorials, interviews, research papers for outstanding the current state-of-the-art of AI; on the far right, finally, there is proposed a personal schema of communicative alignments between agents in a grounded context analyzed from a Cognitive Semiotics to an Experimental Pragmatics point of views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the file is often updated, the GDoc format is the most suitable one: this mean that everybody can see the file, but first needs my approvation. "
